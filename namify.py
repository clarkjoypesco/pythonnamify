# Define a procedure, namify, that takes as
# input a string, and returns a string that
# is an uppercase 'N' followed by the input string.
# for example, when you enter

# print namify('ationals')

# the output should be the string 'Nationals'


def namify(s):
    return 'N' + s








# Remove the hash, #, from infront of print to test your code.

print namify('orwegians')
#>>> Norweigians

print namify('orth')
#>>> North

print namify('ull')
#>>> Null
